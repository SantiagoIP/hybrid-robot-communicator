## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive model of human-robot interaction stages, demonstrating the progression from completely separate workspaces to collaborative environments where humans and robots work together seamlessly. It serves as both an educational tool and a practical demonstration of modern web development in the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

### Key Concepts

- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots
- **Co-evolutionary Systems**: Systems where humans and robots adapt and learn from each other
- **Progressive Integration**: The gradual process of combining human and robotic capabilities

### Stages of Evolution

1. **Cell (Isolation)**: Robots and humans operate in completely separate spaces
   - Clear physical boundaries
   - Independent operation
   - No direct interaction

2. **Coexistence**: Shared environment with independent work
   - Same physical space
   - Parallel operations
   - Basic awareness

3. **Synchronised**: Shared workspace with time-separated operations
   - Coordinated timing
   - Sequential tasks
   - Enhanced safety protocols

4. **Cooperation**: Simultaneous work on separate tasks
   - Parallel processing
   - Task allocation
   - Resource sharing

5. **Collaboration**: Joint work on shared tasks
   - Combined efforts
   - Shared objectives
   - Mutual support

6. **Co-evolution**: Advanced integration with mutual learning and adaptation
   - Continuous improvement
   - Adaptive behaviors
   - Dynamic optimization

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Modern UI development with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for enhanced reliability
- **Vite**: Next-generation build tool for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and interactions
- **Lucide Icons**: Modern, consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
