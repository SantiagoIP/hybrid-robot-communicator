# Human-Robot Collaboration in Teams

An interactive web application exploring the evolution of human-robot collaboration, from isolated operations to advanced co-evolutionary integration.

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive model of human-robot interaction stages, demonstrating the progression from completely separate workspaces to collaborative environments where humans and robots work together seamlessly.

### Stages of Evolution

1. **Cell (Isolation)**: Robots and humans operate in completely separate spaces
2. **Coexistence**: Shared environment with independent work
3. **Synchronised**: Shared workspace with time-separated operations
4. **Cooperation**: Simultaneous work on separate tasks
5. **Collaboration**: Joint work on shared tasks
6. **Co-evolution**: Advanced integration with mutual learning and adaptation
